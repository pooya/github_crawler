Github Crawler
==============

This repo includes a bunch of helper functions which are wrappers over github api v3 and a disco job that crawls github.

1. Use a better way for sampling(e.g. snowball sampling)
2. Use OAuth to increase the rate limit.
3. Handle exceeding rate limit and sleep.
4. Prune the final output only the extensions we care about.
